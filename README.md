# Introduction

HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.
Itâ€™s basically the set of rules that your web browser and web servers use to communicate and exchange data over the internet.

# How it works:

When you type a web address (like http://example.com) into your browser and hit enter, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server that hosts that website.

The server then responds with an HTTP response â€” usually containing the web page you asked for (like HTML, images, text, etc.).

Your browser takes that response and displays it as a web page.

# Key points:

- Itâ€™s a protocol â€” a system of rules for transmitting data.
- Itâ€™s stateless â€” it doesnâ€™t remember anything between different requests (unless you use things like cookies or sessions).
- Modern websites often use HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure), which is the secure, encrypted version of HTTP.

# What is HTTPS?

HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure.
Itâ€™s the secure version of HTTP, the protocol your web browser uses to communicate with websites.

When you visit a website starting with https://, it means:

The data sent between your browser and the website is encrypted.

Hackers or eavesdroppers canâ€™t easily see or tamper with the information being exchanged.

# How does HTTPS work?

It uses a technology called SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security) to:

1. Encrypt the connection between your browser and the web server.
2. Authenticate the websiteâ€™s identity through a digital certificate.
3. Secure the data being sent â€” so even if someone intercepts it, they canâ€™t read it.

# Why HTTPS is important:

1. Protects sensitive data (like passwords, personal details, credit card info)
2. Prevents tampering or spying by malicious parties
3. Builds trust (most browsers show a ðŸ”’ lock icon)
4. Boosts SEO rankings â€” Google favors HTTPS sites

# Example:

- HTTP: http://example.com â€” not secure
- HTTPS: https://example.com â€” secure (with encryption)
